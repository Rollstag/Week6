If you don't have anything else you can use this:
April is the most tropical month, snorkeling
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring snow.
Winter kept us warm, covering
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
A little life with dried tubers.
